# Easy Recruit - Recruitment Platform

## Introduction

EasyRecruit is a website that allows users to submit a profile, including a CV in .pdf format, for review.
Applicants can register for an account and login later with their account details. Once they submit a
profile, they can return to view the submitted profile. They can also browse open job positions.

Staff members who have been signed up (i.e. who I've already put in the staff table of the database) can
register to create a password. Once logged in, staff can review all applicant's profiles, and choose
whether to accept or reject an applicant, or leave them in the list for someone else to review. They can
also see a table of all the applicants reviewed, along with the staff member who reviewed the applicant,
as well as the applicant's email address in case they'd like to get in contact. The main aim of the platform
is to make profiles easy to read and review on one screen.
